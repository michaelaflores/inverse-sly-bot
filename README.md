# inverse-sly-bot

For when you need to track the P/L of the new Scott Galloway.

The Portfolio tracking functionality is very early WIP, mostly this repo sets up a TS Discord bot able to parse responses.

Note that you can run this in your own server by adding the bot in the Discord bot dashboard, and generating a token and replacing the hard coded example token.
